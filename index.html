								<h2 class="major">About myself</h2>
								<p> Hello, my name is <strong>Henryk Mudlaff</strong>. I am second year IT student at
									<strong>
										<a href="https://gdansk.pja.edu.pl/pl/" target="_blank">
									Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology in Gda≈Ñsk
										</a>
									</strong>.
									My adventure with being Softer Engineer with java is starting, but I'm highly motivated to start my career in the IT industry.
								</p>

								<p>
									I did finish Technical school on the field of information technology in Wejherowo and obtain the title of IT technician.
								</p>
<hr>
								<p>
									In the past I did train a lot of sports, among others karate shotokan, basketball and swimming.
									In Karate, I went to many competitions and I managed to take many medal places.
									Currently, I train sporadically and recreationally due to the injuries I acquired during the years of training and competitions.
								</p>

								<p>
									Years which I have spend on training sports taught me, dedication to the goal, hardworking skills and
									managing my time to reach the destination in the best way.
									Training sessions are not the same as before but skills acquired in the past have stayed.
								</p>

								</ul>
								At the university I am learning right now advanced Java, maven, Postman and working with Spring boot.
								Button above is linked with one of repositories with project, were I am working on
								and microservice. Repository with this microservice is named as Rental Service
								(<strong><a href="https://github.com/s26071-pj/RentalService" target="_blank">
								Here is link to mentioned microservice</a></strong>). In this project I did learn about
								creating and using bean's and dependency injection. In Movie Service the university database was
								used.
								Also in this project I did learn how to prepare API documentation using Swagger ui and how
								to customise it.
								</p>

								</ul>
										Next repository is with project that is representing Bank Service. Here I learned
								how unity test are created and how to test application with Swagger UI.
								This is very simple system that is showing bank transaction like payment and withdraw of
								given user
								</p>
<hr>
								<p>
									There are not all the projects I have worked on and are working on, but they are some
									of the most sensible ones. I am constantly trying to supplement my knowledge in
									working in Java and its frameworks along with testing programs and databases.

								<h2 class="major">Work and experience</h2>
								<p>At this point I do not have commercial experience as a Software Engineering, but I would love to start working and gather the required and valuable experience.</p>

									<a href="https://www.info-marine.com/home" target="_blank"> <img src="./images/info_marine.png" alt="Info Marine Logo" style="width:215px;height:150px"> </a>
									<br>
									Currently I am working in company named "Info Marine sp. z. o. o." and I am part of Analysis Department, more specific I am a Junior there, and I am taking care of
									initial processing of machine vibration measurements data and uploading them to the database, then I create a data sheet and conduct an initial review of the measurements
									comparing them with previous ones and whether the machine hours are in good condition.
									After finishing my part of the task I am sending thank mail to ship crew with question about something that attract attention or about information provided by crew.
								</p>
								<p>
									Thanks to this job, I learned analytical thinking and a technical approach to talking to a client.
								</p>

								<p>
									Previous place of employment was as an intern in Department of IT and Communication at Prison in Wronki.&nbsp;
									The equipment on which most of the activities were performed came from Cisco. My main tasks there were network maintenance and installation, equipment status check and
									installation of new technologies such as new RJ45 CAT 6 sockets, new switches and VOIP telephone network.
								</p>
								<p>Thank to this job, I learned how should service of network devices looks like, development of existing network, programming cisco and VOIP equipment. Due to working in a unique place
									such as Prison, I acquired the skill to work under the pressure and out of comfort zone.
