		<article id="about">
			<h2 class="major">About me</h2>
			<p> Hello, my name is <strong>Henryk Mudlaff</strong>. I am second year IT student at
				<strong>
					<a href="https://gdansk.pja.edu.pl/pl/" target="_blank">
						Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology in Gda≈Ñsk
					</a>
				</strong>.
				My adventure with Java is just beginning, and I'm highly motivated to start my career in the IT industry.
			</p>

			<p>
				I graduated from Technical school in the field of information technology in Wejherowo and got the title of IT technician.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the past, I have trained in various sports, including Karate Shotokan, basketball, and swimming.
				In Karate, I participated in numerous competitions and achieved several medal placements.
				Currently, I am engaged in occasional and recreational training.

			</p>

			<p>
				Dedication to the goal, ability to work hard,
				perfect time and resource management - those are the assets I have gained over the years that I have spend on training.
				Training sessions differs from the past ones, but the skills acquired are still with me.

			</p>
			<hr>
			<h2 class="major">Projects</h2>
			<p>At the university, I currently learn advanced Java, Maven, Postman, and working with Spring Boot.</p>

			<p>
				<h3>Movie Service and Rental Service</h3>
			<br>
			This project is presenting the logic of the work of a movie rental shop.<br><br>
			In Movie Service is created whole logic of renting the movie and all information about movies are saved in database.<br><br>
			In Rental Service contains logic of checking the status of rented movies and if it is possible to rent a movie again.<br><br>

			The button "Source code" is linked to the repository with a project where I am working on microservice project.
			Main repository is named "Movie Service" and microservice repository is named "Rental Service".
			(<strong><a href="https://github.com/s26071-pj/RentalService" target="_blank">Here is the link to the mentioned microservice</a></strong>).
			<br><br>
			The university database was used in the Movie Service. <br><br>
			In this project, I have learnt about creating and using beans, how to connect main project with microservice and dependency injection.<br>
			Additionally, in this project, I learned how to prepare API documentation using Swagger UI and how to customize it.

		<article id="work">
			<h2 class="major">Work and experience</h2>
			<p>At this point I do not have commercial experience as a Software Developer, but I would love to start working and gather the required and valuable experience.</p>

			<p>
				<a href="https://www.info-marine.com/home" target="_blank"> <img src="./images/info_marine.png" alt="Info Marine Logo" style="width:215px;height:150px"> </a>
				<br>
				My last place of employment was company named 'Info Marine sp. z o.o.' and I was part of the Analysis Department.<br><br>
				More specifically, I hold the position of a Junior. <br><br>
				My responsibilities involve:
				<ul>
					<li>the initial processing of machine vibration measurement data and uploading it to database</li>
					<li>create data sheets and conduct an initial review of the measurements</li>
					<li>comparing them with previous records to ensure the machine hours are within good condition</li>
				</ul>

				Once I complete my tasks, I sent a thank-you email to the ship's crew, addressing any concerns or
				seeking clarifications on the information provided by the crew earlier.
			</p>
			<p>
				Thanks to this job, I have learnt analytical thinking and technical approach to talking to a client.

			<p>
				I was previously employed as an intern in the Department of IT and Communication at the Penitentiary in Wronki.<br><br>
				The majority of my tasks involved:
			<ul>
			<li>working with Cisco equipment, where I was responsible for network maintenance</li>
			<li>installation, equipment status checks, and implementing new technologies such as RJ45 CAT 6 sockets, switches, and VOIP telephone networks</li>
			</ul>

			</p>
			<p>Thanks to this job, I have learnt what a proper service of network devices should look like, as well as
				how to develop an existing network and program Cisco and VOIP equipment.<br>
				Due to working in a unique environment like penitentiary, I acquired the ability to work under pressure and step out of my comfort zone.
