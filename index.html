			<h2 class="major">About myself</h2>
			<p> Hello, my name is <strong>Henryk Mudlaff</strong>. I am second year IT student at
				<strong>
					<a href="https://gdansk.pja.edu.pl/pl/" target="_blank">
						Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology in Gda≈Ñsk
					</a>
				</strong>.
				My adventure with java is just starting, but I'm highly motivated to start my career in the IT industry.
			</p>

			<p>
				I finished Technical school in the field of information technology in Wejherowo and obtained the title of IT technician.
			</p>
			<hr>
			<p>
				In the past, I have trained in various sports, including Karate Shotokan, basketball, and swimming.
				In Karate, I participated in numerous competitions and achieved several medal placements.
				Currently, I engage in sporadic and recreational training due to the injuries I have sustained over the years of training and competing.

			</p>

			<p>
				ears which I have spent on training sports have taught me dedication to the goal, hardworking skills,
				and managing my time to reach the destination in the best way.
				Training sessions are not the same as before, but the skills acquired in the past have stayed.
			</p>

			</ul>
			At the university, I am currently learning advanced Java, Maven, Postman, and working with Spring Boot.
			The button above is linked to one of the repositories with a project where I am working on a microservice.
			The repository for this microservice is named 'Rental Service'
			(<strong><a href="https://github.com/s26071-pj/RentalService" target="_blank">Here is the link to the mentioned microservice</a></strong>).
			In this project, I learned about creating and using beans and dependency injection. The university database was used in the Movie Service.
			Additionally, in this project, I learned how to prepare API documentation using Swagger UI and how to customize it.
			</p>

			</ul>
			The next repository contains a project that represents the Bank Service.
			Here, I learned how to create unit tests and how to test applications using Swagger UI.
			This is a simple system that displays bank transactions such as payments and withdrawals for a given user.
			</p>
			<hr>
			<p>
				These are not all the projects I have worked on or currently working on, but they are some of the most significant ones.
				I am constantly striving to enhance my knowledge and experience in working with Java and its frameworks, as well as testing programs and databases.

			<h2 class="major">Work and experience</h2>
			<p>At this point I do not have commercial experience as a Software Developer, but I would love to start working and gather the required and valuable experience.</p>
			<hr>
			<p>
				<a href="https://www.info-marine.com/home" target="_blank"> <img src="./images/info_marine.png" alt="Info Marine Logo" style="width:215px;height:150px"> </a>
				<br>
				Currently, I am finishing working in a company named 'Info Marine sp. z o.o.' as part of the Analysis Department.
				More specifically, I hold the position of a Junior. My responsibilities involve the initial processing of machine vibration measurement data and uploading it to the database.
				I also create data sheets and conduct an initial review of the measurements, comparing them with previous records to ensure the machine hours are within good condition.
				Once I complete my tasks, I send a thank-you email to the ship's crew, addressing any concerns or seeking clarification on the information provided by the crew.
			</p>
			<p>
				Thanks to this job, I learned analytical thinking and a technical approach to talking to a client.
			</p>
			<hr>
			<p>
				My previous employment was as an intern in the Department of IT and Communication at the Prison in Wronki.
				The majority of my tasks involved working with Cisco equipment, where I was responsible for network maintenance,
				installation, equipment status checks, and implementing new technologies such as RJ45 CAT 6 sockets, switches, and VOIP telephone networks.
			</p>
			<p>Thanks to this job, I learned what a proper service of network devices should look like, as well as how to develop an existing network and program Cisco and VOIP equipment.
				Due to working in a unique environment like a prison, I acquired the ability to work under pressure and step out of my comfort zone.
